    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: December 2025</p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how the Live Stream News project (“LSN”,
      “we”, “us”, or “our”) handles information in connection with the LSN Bot,
      LSN websites, and related services.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Access</h2>
    <p>
      LSN primarily works with publicly available information, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Public posts, clips, and streams from creators;</li>
      <li>Public platform announcements (for example, policy updates);</li>
      <li>Messages or content you choose to send directly to LSN (such as tips or feedback).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When you interact with LSN in a Discord server or on other platforms, we
      may see your username, profile image, and any messages you send in public
      channels, as allowed by that platform’s API and settings.
    </p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>We may use the information we access to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Generate and publish automated news posts and summaries;</li>
      <li>Provide moderation or community features in LSN-managed servers;</li>
      <li>Monitor basic analytics such as engagement and error logs to keep the bot running reliably;</li>
      <li>Respond to reports, takedown requests, or abuse complaints.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
    <p>
      LSN does not intentionally build a detailed profile of individual users.
      Logs and cached data may be stored temporarily on our servers or services
      we use (for example, hosting providers or logging tools). We keep this
      information only as long as needed for operational, security, or
      troubleshooting purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Sharing of Information</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell your personal information. We may share limited information:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>With service providers that help us operate LSN (such as hosting, logging, or monitoring tools);</li>
      <li>When required by law, regulation, or legal process;</li>
      <li>To investigate misuse of LSN, protect our rights, or protect other users.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Platforms</h2>
    <p>
      When you use LSN on Discord, TikTok, YouTube, X, or any other platform,
      your activity is also subject to that platform’s own privacy policy and
      settings. We do not control how those platforms collect or use data. You
      should review their privacy policies for details.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      LSN is intended for a general audience of adults and older teens who are
      allowed to use social platforms under their own terms. We do not
      knowingly target or collect information from children under the minimum
      age required to use those platforms.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Your Choices</h2>
    <p>
      If you do not want LSN to see messages from you, you may avoid using
      commands that interact with the bot or leave communities where LSN is
      installed. If you are a creator and would like us to remove or correct a
      post about you, you can contact us using the information below.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will
      change the “Last updated” date at the top of this page. Your continued use
      of LSN after any changes means you accept the revised Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Contact</h2>
    <p>
      If you have questions about this Policy or wish to request the removal of
      specific content, you can contact the project owner via the email address
      listed on the primary LSN social profiles.
