    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: December 2025</p>

    <p>
      These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Live
      Stream News project, including the LSN Bot, LSN-branded websites, and any
      related services (collectively, “LSN”, “we”, “us”, or “our”). By accessing
      or using LSN, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>1. What LSN Is</h2>
    <p>
      LSN is an informational project that automatically discovers, summarizes,
      and posts news-style updates about livestreamers, gaming creators, award
      shows, and platform changes. Content may be published on third-party
      platforms such as Discord, TikTok, X, or YouTube using our own accounts.
    </p>
    <p>
      LSN is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or officially connected to any of
      these platforms or any creators we may mention. All names, logos, and
      trademarks belong to their respective owners.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Not Professional Advice</h2>
    <p>
      Content generated and posted by LSN is for entertainment and general
      information only. It should not be treated as professional, legal, or
      financial advice. You are solely responsible for how you choose to use or
      rely on the information we provide.
    </p>

    <h2>3. User Conduct</h2>
    <p>When interacting with LSN or any LSN-managed communities (such as Discord), you agree that you will not:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use LSN to harass, threaten, or defame any person or group;</li>
      <li>Post or request content that is illegal, hateful, or is likely to violate a platform’s rules;</li>
      <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to our systems or accounts;</li>
      <li>Use LSN output as if it were official statements from any creator, platform, or brand.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Platform Rules</h2>
    <p>
      LSN operates on top of services provided by third-party platforms. When you
      view or engage with LSN content on those platforms, you must also comply
      with their terms of service and community guidelines (for example, those of
      Discord, TikTok, YouTube, Twitch, or X). If there is a conflict between
      these Terms and a platform’s rules, the platform’s rules control your use
      of that platform.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Content and Attribution</h2>
    <p>
      LSN may quote, embed, or link to content from creators and platforms for
      commentary, reporting, or news-style coverage. We try to include context
      and sources where reasonable, but we do not guarantee completeness or
      accuracy. If you believe content misrepresents you or your work, you can
      contact us using the information listed in our Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>6. AI-Generated Material</h2>
    <p>
      Some LSN content is generated or assisted by artificial intelligence tools.
      AI-generated material can occasionally be inaccurate, out of date, or
      incomplete. We may label posts as being automatically generated or
      currently being verified. You understand and agree that you use such
      content at your own risk.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      To the fullest extent permitted by law, LSN and its contributors will not
      be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or
      punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred
      directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, goodwill, or other intangible
      losses, resulting from (a) your use of or inability to use LSN; or
      (b) any content obtained from LSN.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Changes to LSN or These Terms</h2>
    <p>
      We may modify or discontinue parts of LSN at any time. We may also update
      these Terms occasionally. When we do, we will update the “Last updated”
      date above. Your continued use of LSN after changes become effective
      constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Contact</h2>
    <p>
      If you have questions about these Terms or believe content posted by LSN
      infringes your rights, you may reach out to the project owner at the
      contact email listed on the relevant LSN profile or platform.
